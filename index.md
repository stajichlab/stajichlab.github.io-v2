## Fungal Evolutionary Genomics Lab

{% capture text %}
[Research](research) in the lab focuses on evolution of fungi through use of genetic and genomic approaches incorporating experimental and computational tools. We are focused on evolutionary relationships of fungi in particular [zygomycete](http://zygolife.org/home/) and chytrid fungi. <br>
